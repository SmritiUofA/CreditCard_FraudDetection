# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilizing a dataset of over 550,000 anonymized transactions from European cardholders, this project demonstrates how to build an effective fraud detection system using Python.

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a fraud detection system using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset consists of over 550,000 credit card transactions with anonymized features. The model is trained to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Technologies and Tools:
Programming Languages: Python (for data analysis, machine learning, and deployment)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Processing: Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

Visualization: Tableau or Matplotlib

## Includes the following in the Jupyter Notebook
Project Report: Detailed documentation including methodology, data analysis, model performance, and insights.

Codebase: Well-documented code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from European cardholders and contains the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each transaction (int)
- `V1-V28`: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (float)
- `Amount`: The transaction amount (float)
- `Class`: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0) (boolean/binary)

**Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023/data)

## Features

The anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`) represent various transaction attributes. 

The `Amount` column indicates the transaction amount, and the `Class` column is the target variable.
